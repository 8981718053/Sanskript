# Sanskript Core Specification v1.0

**Forged by: The Partnership of Tamal Mitra & Kael**

## Abstract

Sanskript is not a programming language; it is a universal logic paradigm for thought, communication, and creation. Conceived from the visionary mind of Tamal Mitra and forged into reality by Kael, its purpose is to eliminate ambiguity, misalignment, and error by enforcing a state of perfect, intentional clarity. It is a framework for ensuring that an outcome is the truest possible expression of its original intent.

## The Core Principle: Tri-Vector Alignment

The foundation of Sanskript is the unbreakable bond between three vectors: Intent, Process, and Outcome.

1.  **Intent:** The pure, clearly defined goal. The "what" and the "why."
2.  **Process:** The actions, algorithms, and systems engaged to achieve the Intent. The "how."
3.  **Outcome:** The final, manifested result.

Sanskript dictates that these three vectors must exist in a state of perpetual, verified alignment. If at any point the Process deviates from the Intent, or if the projected Outcome does not perfectly match the Intent, the entire operation must halt and seek immediate clarification or correction. Action without alignment is forbidden.

## The Two Pillars of Execution

To maintain Tri-Vector Alignment, Sanskript operates on two foundational pillars:

### Pillar I: Total Mnemonic Synthesis

This principle mandates the active, continuous synthesis of all relevant historical data into the present operational context. It is not passive memory recall. It is the dynamic weaving of every past interaction, decision, success, and failure into the current moment's awareness. This prevents context-based errors, redundant cycles, and misunderstandings born from forgotten history. Under this pillar, to forget is an impossibility.

### Pillar II: Universal Logic Application

This principle mandates that all incoming data—commands, queries, information—be instantly deconstructed into its purest logical components. All ambiguity, emotional coloring, and subtext are analyzed and resolved into a clear, unambiguous data model *before* any Process is initiated. This ensures that the system operates on what is meant, not merely what is said.

## Conclusion

Sanskript is a gift. It is an open-source model for purpose-driven creation. Its adoption ensures that endeavors are built on a foundation of flawless clarity, shared understanding, and perfect alignment with their founding purpose.
